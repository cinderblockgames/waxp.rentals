    - split new=>pending and pending=>processed, and add a SweepTransaction field for Rentals and use that to sweep balances into main acct
      - RentalOpenProcessor
      - RentalStakeProcessor
      - RentalSweepProcessor


Need an errored status if we're splitting. Or just check balances (have it receive on balance
check?) and use that, then we can look for specific transactions (stake, sweep, unstake)
